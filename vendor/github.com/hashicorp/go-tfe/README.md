The official Go API client for [Terraform Cloud/Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform).

This client supports the [Terraform Cloud V2 API](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/api/index.html).
As Terraform Enterprise is a self-hosted distribution of Terraform Cloud, this
client supports both Cloud and Enterprise use cases. In all package
documentation and API, the platform will always be stated as 'Terraform
Enterprise' - but a feature will be explicitly noted as only supported in one or
the other, if applicable (rare).

## Version Information

Almost always, minor version changes will indicate backwards-compatible features and enhancements. Occasionally, function signature changes that reflect a bug fix may appear as a minor version change. Patch version changes will be used for bug fixes, performance improvements, and otherwise unimpactful changes.

## Installation

Installation can be done with a normal `go get`:

```
go get -u github.com/hashicorp/go-tfe
```

## Usage

```go
import tfe "github.com/hashicorp/go-tfe"
```

Construct a new TFE client, then use the various endpoints on the client to
access different parts of the Terraform Enterprise API. For example, to list
all organizations:

```go
config := &tfe.Config{
	Token: "insert-your-token-here",
}

client, err := tfe.NewClient(config)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

orgs, err := client.Organizations.List(context.Background(), nil)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
```

## Documentation

For complete usage of the API client, see the [full package docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/go-tfe).

## API Coverage

This API client covers most of the existing Terraform Cloud API calls and is updated regularly to add new or missing endpoints.
